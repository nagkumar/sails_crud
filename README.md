# restful json CRUD api from scratch
### a Sails application

This repo is related to the second episode of a three part series.  Episode I: We'll start with how the http request/response protocol works with routes, controllers, actions and models to deliver a restful json CRUD api.  Episode II: (This episode and repo) By the end of the second episode you'll use these concepts to build a restful json CRUD api from scratch. In the third episode we'll explore how sail's *blueprint: actions and routes* can be used to create that same restful json CRUD api automatically for any of your controllers and models.
